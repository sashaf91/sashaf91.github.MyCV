<h1><b>Bio</b></h1>
<body>
    <p>
        I am a confident, positive, enthusiastic, hardworking and trustworthy employee. I have always
        proven to be a reliable and a flexible member of the team and would like to take the opportunity to
        assure you that I will be an asset to the company. I will commit to the working hours required and to
        go the extra mile to meet your needs. I strive to perform to the best of my ability and I am
        committed to reaching my personal goals as well as the organizations goals set out.</p>
    <p> I have 2 years experience as an ODA with Mediclinic Kouis Leipoldt. After a year and a half I was promoted to senior management and running the sterile department
         with 8 staff members below me. I have to manage the staff, their daily allocations and ensuring that the theatre department runs smoothly and have the necessary
         equipment that they require. </p>
    <p> I love working in healthcare and being able to make a difference in peoples lives every single day. This is what motivates me and wanting to be the best version
         of myself possible. I strive to be the best and to be better than the day before.</p>
